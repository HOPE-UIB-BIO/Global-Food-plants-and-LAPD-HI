# Pollen-based evidence of food plants globally and human impact in pollen-records in Latin America
Welcome to the repository for our research project on pollen-based evidence of food plants around the world and human presence in fossil records in Latin America. This project focuses on the identification and analysis of anthopogenic pollen indicators (i.e. human indicators) in pollen data, aiming to reconstruct aspects of human history.

## Project Structure
The data folder contains the dataset used for the creating of the different figures of the publication (Flantua & Hooghiemstra, in review).
The R folder holds R scripts for visualization using ggplot2.
The plots folder contains generated visualizations.

## Figures (plots) (NEEDS UPDATING)
human_indicators_plot.png: Bar plot illustrating the distribution of human indicators in fossil pollen records.
human_indicators_grouped_plot.png: Bar plot illustrating the distribution of human indicators in fossil pollen records with color scheme on frequency. 
human_indicators_facets_plot: Horizontal bar plots with facets, providing insights into human indicator prevalence.
human_indicators_facetted_plot2+3.png: Multi-grouped bar plot showcasing the frequency distribution of human indicators per percentage groups. Figure has been slightly adjusted for publication for readibility of group 1-2%.
