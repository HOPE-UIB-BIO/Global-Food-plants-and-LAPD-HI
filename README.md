# Pollen-based evidence of food plants globally and human impact in pollen-records in Latin America
Welcome to the repository for our research project on pollen-based evidence of food plants around the world and human presence in fossil records in Latin America. This project focuses on the identification and analysis of anthopogenic pollen indicators (i.e. human indicators) in pollen data, aiming to reconstruct aspects of human history.

## Project Structure
The data folder contains the dataset used for the creating of the different figures of the publication (Flantua & Hooghiemstra, in review).
The R folder holds R scripts for visualization using ggplot2.
The plots folder contains generated visualizations.

## Figures
Figure 2: Distribution of human indicators in fossil pollen records in Latin America. 
Figure 3. Number of times each human indicator was identified in references in Latin America on (fossil) pollen records. 
Figure 4. Locations of the references with human indices.
